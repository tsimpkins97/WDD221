        <h2><b>About Me:</b></h2>
        <p>I am majoring in Web Design &amp; Development here at Stark State and work in social media management for a disability advocacy organization. I am married and have three cats named Gus, Millie, and Frank. When I am not working or focusing on school, I enjoy reading, playing vdeo games, going to concerts, learning to build computers, and traveling when I can.</p>
